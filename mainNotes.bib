@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="In refs.~\protect \citenum  {DelJunco2018b} and \protect \citenum  {Barato2017}, $\phi $ was defined as the eigenvalue with the least negative real part. However, in the multi-cyclic networks we address later in this paper, that definition can lead to selecting an eigenvalue which corresponds to cycling around a small decoration rather than global oscillations."}
