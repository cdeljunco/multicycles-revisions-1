\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces A schematic of the networks studied in this article. (a) In previous work\nobreakspace  {}\cite  {DelJunco2018b}, we developed an analytical theory for the period of oscillations $T$ and the number of coherent oscillations $\mathcal  R$, defined in Eq.\nobreakspace  {}2{}{}{}\hbox {}, in oscillators that can be represented by a single cycle of states where the clockwise (CW) hopping rates ($k_i^+$) are much larger than the counterclockwise (CCW) hopping rates ($k_i^-$). This asymmetry is quantified by the affinity $\mathcal  A$, defined in Eq.\nobreakspace  {}1{}{}{}\hbox {}. (b) In this work, we extend our results to networks where the main cycle is decorated with many small cycles. (c) We design these `decorations' so that the rates going into them are modulated by a small parameter $\mu $ which governs the probability that the system will enter the small cycle. (d) To apply our theory to these multi-cycle networks, we map the muti-cyclic network on to a unicyclic network by matching moments of the first passage time distribution for a random walk beginning CCW from the decoration (green circle) and ending CW from it (red circle) on to a line of states with two unknown hopping rate. This procedure gives a set of effective hopping rates $\eta _i^\pm $. When each of the decorations in the network is coarse-grained in this manner, we obtain a single-cycle network as in (a) whose period $T$ and coherence $\mathcal  R$ should approximate those of the full, multicycle network.}}{2}{}}

Dashed lines are the period as the affinity is changed with $\mu = \mu _0$; solid lines are the period when $\mu $ is changed as a function of the affinity: $\mu =\mu _0 + \Delta \mu $ with $\Delta \mu = \kappa _{comp}\Delta \mathcal  A$, as described in the text. This linear compensation mechanism is effective over a wide range of affinities $\mathcal  A_0$, compensating for changes in the period of $\sim 50\%$. Compensation occurs because by increasing (decreasing) $\mu $ the system is encouraged to spend more (less) time in the triangle decorations as the affinity is increased (decreased). Inset: The integrated deviation from perfect compensation ($T/T_0 = 1$) over the range $\Delta \mathcal  A\in [-0.3, 0.3]$ as a function of the affinity in the unperturbed network. The mechanism is most effective when $\mathcal  A_0/N \approx 2$ or greater.}}{6}{}}
